## 🎨 Branding

The **VaultWares Theme** design system has been added as a git submodule to `vault-themes/`.

When incorporating logos (such as favicons or when the full logo doesn't fit), use the **minimal logos** which feature only the "V" part of the logo.

- **Minimal Logos:** Located at `vault-themes/Brand/minimal-logos/`
- **Favicons:** Located at `vault-themes/Brand/favicons/`

**Note:** The `-ink-filled`, `-mono-filled`, and `gold-filled` versions should be the default variations used.
